# portfolio

## Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those challenges. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
During the process, I found out that using a CSS library and framework is useful for building a website. However, when it came to customizing certain details such as padding and positioning, there were many restrictions in modifying them. I attempted to customize them using CSS alone, but found it difficult without utilizing SASS. After creating my web portfolio, I gained a better understanding of the relationship between HTML and CSS, as well as the importance of the link order of CSS for optimizing web page performance.
